# Code-Revision-Application

The application simulates the code revision process. When the application is launched, a new window is created for each programmer and a new window shows the statistics about the programmers and the revised files. Any programmer can add a new file or they can revise the files loaded by other programmers. Each programmer has a number of files to revise and when they reach the total number, in the window with the statistics, the programmer will be displayed with blue.
The application is created using the Observer design pattern.
